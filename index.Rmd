Goal of these workshops is to provide an introduction to R as tool to visualize and analyze spatial data. Each part builds on the previous part, so if you are new to R I recommend you take them in the suggested order. If you have prior knowledge of R you can join for only the parts you are interested in. I will do my best to make the workshops as hands on as possible and provide code for you to work through. Due to my background, examples are social science biased. 

These workshops require a basic familiarity with R. __If you don't know R at all, please take the Introductory R workshop__ (Feb. 3, 3:30-5:30 PM, IC classroom in Green East), which is offered by [SSDS](https://ssds.stanford.edu/).

### A word about R notebooks

- Workshop materials are provided [as R notebooks](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html).
- You can download the _.Rmd_ file that generates the notebook using the dropdown (top right).
- Here is what you can do with it:
    - Install [version 1.0 or higher of RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), 
    - Open the notebook file. 
    - Execute the R code directly in the notebook using the little green arrow on top of each R code chunk.
