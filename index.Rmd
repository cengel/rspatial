Goal of this workshop is to provide an introduction to R as tool to visualize and analyze spatial data. You will learn about the structure and characteristics of the `sp` and the `sf` spatial objects in R, you will explore some spatial operations, and you will get an overview of how you can plot and map spatial data interactively from R.

This workshop requires a basic familiarity with R. __If you don't know R at all, please take the Introductory R workshop__ (offered [Friday, May 19, 2017](https://events.stanford.edu/events/695/69569/))


### Upcoming spatial workshop (please sign up [here](https://goo.gl/forms/6YXrMVAkzKJYnJIz1)):

- [Spatial data types in R](2_spDataTypes.nb.html) (requires introductory knowledge about R) 
- [Spatial operations in R](3_spDataOps.nb.html) (requires knowledge about R spatial data types) 
- [Making maps in R](4_Mapping.nb.html) (requires knowledge about R spatial data types)

### A word about R notebooks

- Workshop materials are provided [as R notebooks](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html).
- You can download the _.Rmd_ file that generates the notebook using the dropdown (top right).
- Here is what you can do with it:
    - Install [version 1.0 or higher of RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), 
    - Open the notebook file. 
    - Execute the R code directly in the notebook using the little green arrow on top of each R code chunk.
